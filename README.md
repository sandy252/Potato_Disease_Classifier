# Potato Disease Classfication

An end to end system which can identiy disease in photo plant. It takes input in the form of image(image of a potato leaf) and then classifies the leaf as healty, late blight or early blight. One can also use camera of respective device in which the app in running, to take the picture of a potato leaf in real time and classify the plant. Here late blight and early blight are 2 types of disease which a potato plant often suffer from. In addition to the classification the system also determines its confidence on each prediction.
